## Objective
Develop a fast-paced 3D puzzle game set in a chaotic factory environment through a semester long production cycle.  
The project was completed over **15 sprints (one per week)** using **Unreal Engine 5**, with a full Scrum framework including sprint planning, daily scrums, retrospectives, and deliverable tracking through **Trello**.  

My roles included:
- **Scrum Master** — managed sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily standups  
- **Audio/Level Designer** — designed environmental soundscapes and puzzle spaces  
- **Audio Programmer** — implemented sound triggers and logic in Unreal  
- **IT Support** — maintained build stability, version control, and engine troubleshooting
