## Objective
Develop a fast-paced 3D puzzle game set in a chaotic factory environment through a semester long production cycle.  
Over the semester, our team of 7 produced a full Game Design Document, multiple presentation decks, and a final pitch presentation delivered at **Texas Power Hour**, hosted by the **UT Game Development and Design Program**, where developers from various studios provided feedback. We also presented at **Game Worlds**, where industry professionals playtested our game and offered insights for improvement.

My roles included:
- **Scrum Master** — managed sprint planning, retrospectives, and daily standups  
- **Audio/Level Designer** — designed environmental soundscapes and puzzle spaces  
- **Audio Programmer** — implemented sound triggers and logic in Unreal  
- **IT Support** — maintained build stability, version control, and engine troubleshooting
